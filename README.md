# Diaphora
Diaphora (διαφορά, Greek for 'difference') is a program diffing plugin for IDA Pro, similar to Zynamics Bindiff or the FOSS counterparts DarunGrim, TurboDiff, etc... It was released during SyScan 2015.

At the moment, it works with IDA Pro but support for Radare2 (and maybe Pyew or even Hopper) is also planned.
For more details, please check the tutorial in the "doc" directory.
